- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CharlieatPostman and I'm responsibile for growing remote technology hubs for Postman in Europe following our recent $225m Series D 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in speaking to anyone and everyone who is interested in careers at Postman, our growth and our technology culture. Or even for just a chat / confidential recruitment advice, I'm here to help. I'm also interesting in speaking to people who are passionate about the open source community and collaboration in software.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Electron.JS and it's internal workings. We have our own fork which we're using heavily at Postman. Super low level, technical foundations of desktop application development
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: charlie.dyson@postman.com or find me on LinkedIn. Happy to chat anytime ;)
